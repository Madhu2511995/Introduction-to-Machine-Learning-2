    "1. More Data: Increasing the size of the training dataset can help the model learn more generalized patterns, reducing its tendency to overfit noise.\n",

    "2. Simpler Models: Choose simpler model architectures with fewer parameters. This reduces the model's capacity to memorize noise and makes it more likely to capture true underlying patterns.\n",
